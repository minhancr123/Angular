## Usage

### Running the Automation Script
```bash
cd src/app/management/InventoryManagement
node make-responsive.js
```

### Adding New Components
When adding new components to InventoryManagement:

1. Use the provided responsive classes:
   ```html
   <mat-card class="inventory-table-responsive">
   <div class="inventory-card-header">
   <form class="inventory-form-responsive">
   ```

2. Apply proper Bootstrap grid classes:
   ```html
   <div class="col-md-6 col-12">
   <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-12">
   ```

3. Use responsive button groups:
   ```html
   <div class="d-flex gap-2 flex-wrap">
   ```

## Testing
